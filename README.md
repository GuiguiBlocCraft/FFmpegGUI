# FFmpeg GUI

A very simple **graphic user interface** for **FFmpeg** but __only to cut video__. Not other parameters, but you can use your graphic card to make render (encoder used is *h264_nvenc* for my case).

You can cut with **start** and **from**, or with **duration**.

## Requirements

- You must to have **ffmpeg** (and **ffprobe**) in your PATH variable.
- Windows 8 or higher
